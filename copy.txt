INTRO COPY

Welcome to Coffee + Code
Your Local Cafe

In April 2011 we opened our doors on Exmouth Market, intent on bringing to the neighbourhood the very best coffee possible. Sourcing, roasting and brewing great coffee lead to more, and since then, our Clerkenwell cafe has evolved into a thriving destination for coffee, food, beer and wine lovers alike




QUOTE 1

The coffee was really good and the place itself was more than relaxed. I was so comfortable I didn't want to leave. I will definitely return.

— Sophie from London



QUOTE 2

Food and coffee are both exceptional. As expected orange juice is the freshly sqeezed variety. You can't go wrong with the breakfast corn fritters or poached eggs with sourdough and tomato kasundi.

— Jing from London



CUP SECTION

A continually developing focus on conscientious and considered sourcing and preparation underpins everything we do, combined with a desire to always share these goods with our guests in a humble and relaxed way.
